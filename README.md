# Mashed

Mashed is an application revolved around bringing people together through a love for cooking and shared recipes. 
The main focus of the front-end development for Mashed is to properly convey the feelings and thematic messages of what we want Mashed to represent. 
In order to make sure that those messages and themes are portrayed, we focused on the implementation of the design philosophies we created in the previous milestones. 

We are still working on the responsiveness and accessibility of our application and is currently best viewed through the iOS simulator with an iPhone 14 Plus/iPhone 14 Pro Max display.
